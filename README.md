 Handy Health Log is a native Android app, a database for users wishing to keep a diary, journal or running list of health-related 
 events, mostly readings such as blood pressure, glucose levels, or body temperature. The app replaces the inconvenient process of 
 jotting such information in spiral notebooks or on sticky notes which can easily get lost or misplaced.
 
 The app is further intended as a demonstration of my skills as an Android developer. The app incorporates features found in modern
 Android apps such as the RecyclerView, CardViews, the Room Database, LiveData, and the ViewModel. To see other samples of my 
 work, I invite you to visit the Google Play Store and search for my name, "Charles Tatum II".
 
 The first release of the app was not intended to be exhaustive in terms of features, nor splashy in terms of appearance. It's intended
 to be a conventional looking Android app. The app can be found in the Google Play Store as a free offering, but if there's sufficient
 user interest in expanding its features, more development will be done.
 
 The app can also serve as a teaching project for those less familiar with Android concepts.
