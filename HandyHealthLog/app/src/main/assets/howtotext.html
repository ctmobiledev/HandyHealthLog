        <p>HANDY HEALTH LOG is a simple app for recording your personal health care events. It's a lot easier
            jotting them in this app than a spiral notebook, and a lot easier to carry around, too!</p>
        <p>To begin, tap the <b>Add New Event</b> button. The Data Type spinner lets you choose from one of
            the following data event types:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td><b>BP</b></td>
                <td>Blood Pressure Reading. Enter your systolic and diastolic numbers and your pulse in beats per minute.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>EXERC</b></td>
                <td>Exercise. You can enter the number of minutes you were active, or your activity in miles or laps.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>GLU</b></td>
                <td>Glucose/Blood Sugar Reading. Enter your blood sugar count.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>OTHER</b></td>
                <td>Any other measures you wish to record. Use the Description 1 and Description 2 fields as reminders.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>RX</b></td>
                <td>Prescription. For registering when you took a dose of a prescription medication.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>TEMP</b></td>
                <td>Body Temperature Reading. Enter your temperature in degrees F.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>WGT</b></td>
                <td>Weight Reading. Enter your weight in pounds and ounces.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>At any time, you may export all entered data to a CSV file for import to spreadsheet applications such as
            Microsoft Excel (tm) or LibreOffice Calc. Tap the <b>Export Events to CSV File</b> button. The resulting
            file, <b>HealthData.CSV</b>, contains all entries you've made to date. Entries are sorted in chronological order.</p>
        <p>To access this file, you may either (a) use an Android-based file manager app to search for the "HHL" folder, or (b)
            attach your Android device with the USB data/recharge cable and use your computer's file manager to search for the
            "HHL" folder.</p>
        <p>You may also import entries from a CSV file you've copied to your Android device. To do this, tap the <b>Import Events from CSV File</b>
            button. You must have a file called <b>ImportHealthData.CSV</b> in the HHL folder. To get a feel for the format such a file should take
            enter ONE record using <b>Add New Event</b> and then tap the <b>Export Events to CSV File</b> button.</p>
        <p>The first line in the file has headers describing each of the values, and are separated by the vertical bar (|) character.</p>
        <p>All successive lines contain actual data, and values are separated by a vertical bar (|) character. There is no trailing vertical
            bar after the Description 2 data value.
        </p>
        <p><b>NOTE:</b> An import operation will DELETE ALL EXISTING DATA. You'll be asked to confirm this operation before you proceed with it.
        </p>
        <p>Use HANDY HEALTH LOG in good health, and watch the Google Play Store for new features and updates!</p>
